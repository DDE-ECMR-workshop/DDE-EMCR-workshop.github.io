The focus of this Early Career Workshop is on personal development and the connection to professional success. In the morning, activities and discussions aimed at understanding personal priorities and identifying aspirations will provide you with a roadmap that places your personal values in the context of your professional pursuits. In the afternoon, a break-out group mentoring session will provide you the opportunity to have open discussion with fellow ECRâ€™s and an established researcher on topics ranging from career opportunities to work-life balance.
