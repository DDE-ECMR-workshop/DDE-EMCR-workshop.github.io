Claim the future you want.

As Early- and Mid-Career Researchers (ECMRs), we rarely invest the time (*or, rarely feel we can justify the time*) to reflect and plan. Rather than focus on specific skills or tasks (e.g. presentation, proposal-writing or CV workshops you may have attended before), this workshop will give you the opportunity to discuss, plan and consider your future career journey. While the workshop may not help you 'land the job', it may help you decide which jobs are worth landing.

This workshop follows four days of analysing, predicting and facilitating disruptions to the status-quo. As our industry changes, so too do established perceptions of a career. As EMCRs we will encounter new and challenging career hurdles alongside exciting opportunities to forge new paths. We will focus on how a little forward thinking, planning and investment in personal development and community can facilitate sustainable modern careers.

**Note:** The organisers of this workshop are ECMRs themselves. We've noted a specific gap in the types of workshops we've attended in the past (most practical, some useful), and we envisaged this workshop. We aim to provide you with useful exercises, productive discussion and a bit of time to think around planning for modern careers. We've lined up a number of interesting and enthusiastic panellists and mentors to help provide the perspective and insight which comes with experience. We want this to be a positive and productive experience for you, and hope you're eager to get involved in these discussions and make the most of the workshop for yourself.
