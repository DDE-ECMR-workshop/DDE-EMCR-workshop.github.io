This code of conduct serves to describe the standard of behaviour expected in all spaces relevant to the Cutting Edge Science Symposium on Digital Disruption in Exploration (CESS-DDE; including all conference events, communications and online spaces). All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organisers and volunteers are required to conform to the following code of conduct, and this code will be enforced throughout the event.
Expected Behaviour

CESS-DDE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We will not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

* Be kind and treat others with respect. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
* Behave professionally.
* Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.
* Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are unnecessary and should avoided.
* Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

### Reporting Unacceptable Behaviour

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report either in-person or anonymously, and all reports will be kept confidential.

## Consequences

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the conference organisers will take appropriate action, which may include warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
