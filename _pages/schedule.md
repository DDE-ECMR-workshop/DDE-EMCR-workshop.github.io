The day will have four sections, each of which is planned to build upon the discussions and activities of the last. The morning begins with where you are now, and throughout the afternoon we hope you'll gain further perspective and strategies to make the most of your career journey. The planned schedule is added below.

**Note:** Considering timing conflicts, we've adjusted the schedule to run from lunchtime through to the end of the day. The mentoring session will be run over lunch, to be followed by the planned morning activities and panel session.

### Mentoring Session

During lunch, a break-out group mentoring session will provide you the opportunity to have open discussion with fellow ECMRâ€™s and self-nominated mentors on topics including improving work-life balance, career hurdles and interruptions, through to creating your own career opportunities.

### Retrospective, Perspective, Prospective: Where to From Here?

This session will give you an opportunity to assess your values and priorities, retrospectively examine your path so far, and envisage what you want your future to look like. You'll consider some optimistic professional and personal aspirations and integrate these into a (flexible, potentially non-linear) roadmap going forward. You'll identify the major hurdles and hindrances which could stop you from achieving these milestones, and some potential strategies to capitalise on your strengths to overcome them. Overall, the session should provide you with some useful perspective for  prioritising your career development activities as an EMCR, and form the basis for further discussions later in the day.

### Panel Session

After envisioning your own career trajectory, you'll hear from a number of panellists discussing their own. Our panellists will discuss their careers so far, and provide a short retrospective assessment of some of the drivers and motivations behind the paths taken and decisions made. The latter half of this session will involve a Q/A and directed discussion around a number of topics including:

* Integrating your values into your career planning
* Career challenges, sidesteps and interruptions
* Making your own opportunities
* Managing and investing your time

### Building on Community

The last part of the afternoon will involve identifying opportunities to build local EMCR communities. This will be entirely driven by participants (although some mentors and panellists may decide to join us), and may focus on identifying 'low hanging fruit' with regards to barriers to entry or unnecessary gatekeeping, organising local events or simply unpacking the themes of the discussion throughout the day.

The organisers of this workshop hope to build it into something larger in the coming year (and are in the process of writing grant proposals), and if you have any feedback (positive or otherwise) or would like to get involved on that front, we'd love to hear it.
