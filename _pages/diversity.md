The Cutting Edge Science Symposium on Digital Disruption in Exploration is committed to providing an inclusive, respectful conference environment that encourages participation from people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientations. We’re actively seeking to increase the diversity of our speakers, panellists and attendees through our call for proposals.

### Help Us Achieve Diversity

You can help us create a more diverse conference experience through suggest ways that the conference experience can be more welcoming and supportive, free from intimidation and marginalization.

We strive to provide a conference experience which is welcoming to everyone, and appreciate your contributions to helping us achieve that goal by following our [code of conduct]({{ site.url}}/code-of-conduct/).
